## Overview

This repository contains my individual coursework project for the MCMS program at the University of Sussex. The project was developed using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and focuses on:

- Matrix operations
- Eigenvalue computations
- Probabilistic modeling

All code is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), leveraging its strengths in numerical computing and data analysis.

The project demonstrates the application of linear algebra techniques and simulations to solve problems relevant to numerical analysis and operations research.

## Project Structure

- `*.jl` â€“ Core Julia source code (Pluto notebook)
- `Answer_template.html` â€“ Exported version of the Pluto notebook for convenient viewing (read-only)
